Project Overview
Project Name: Customer Segmentation Using K-Means Clustering
Author: Ntiyiso Ndhlovu
Objective: To segment customers based on their financial behavior and interaction patterns using k-means clustering. This segmentation will help the business tailor marketing strategies, improve customer engagement, and optimize resource allocation.

1. Research Questions
Objective
Define the key questions the project aims to answer.

Key Research Questions:
How can customers be grouped based on their average credit limit, number of credit cards, and interaction with the bank (visits, online interactions, calls)?
What distinct customer segments exist, and how can they be characterized?
How can the insights from these clusters improve customer retention and revenue?

Tasks:
Collaborate with stakeholders to understand business needs and priorities.
Translate business objectives into clustering questions.
Prioritize research questions based on potential business impact.
Ensure alignment with the organizationâ€™s strategic goals.

2. Source Data
Objective
Gather and prepare the relevant data required for analysis.

Key Data Requirements:
Average credit limit for each customer.
Number of credit cards held by each customer.
Frequency of visits to the bank.
Frequency of online interactions.
Number of calls made to customer service.

Tasks:
Identify and validate data sources.
Extract, transform, and load (ETL) the data into a usable format.
Ensure data quality, consistency, and compliance with regulations.
Collaborate with data providers to address any gaps or issues.

3. Analyze Data
Objective
Apply k-means clustering to segment customers into distinct groups based on their data.

Tasks:
Perform data preprocessing, including normalization of features.
Apply k-means clustering to segment customers into distinct groups.
Evaluate the optimal number of clusters using techniques such as the Elbow Method or Silhouette Analysis.
Validate clustering results to ensure robustness and interpretability.
Deliverables:
Cluster profiles detailing the characteristics of each segment.
Statistical summaries and visualizations of clusters.

4. Interpret and Report Results
Objective
Communicate the insights from the clustering analysis in a clear and actionable manner.

Tasks:
Develop visualizations (e.g., scatter plots, heatmaps) to represent clusters.
Translate analytical findings into business insights.
Create a presentation to explain clusters and their business implications.
Provide actionable recommendations for targeted marketing, product development, and customer engagement strategies.

Deliverables:
Comprehensive report detailing customer segments.
Recommendations for leveraging cluster insights.

5. Use Results to Influence Business Decision-Making
Objective
Implement data-driven strategies to drive business outcomes based on the clustering insights.

Tasks:
Work with decision-makers to integrate clustering insights into business strategies.
Develop targeted marketing campaigns for each customer segment.
Monitor the impact of segmentation-based strategies on key performance indicators (KPIs).
Iterate and refine clusters as new data becomes available.

Deliverables:
Implementation plan for segmentation-driven initiatives.
Periodic reports evaluating the impact of strategies on business outcomes.

Observations from Clustering Analysis
Cluster 1 (High-Value, Low Interaction): This group comprises customers with high credit limits and multiple credit cards but minimal interaction with the bank. They likely value efficiency and might respond well to high-tier, low-maintenance service offerings.
Cluster 2 (Low-Value, High Digital Engagement): Customers in this cluster have lower credit limits and fewer credit cards but are highly active online. They may benefit from digital banking enhancements and personalized online offers.
Cluster 3 (Moderate Value, Mixed Interaction): This segment includes customers with moderate financial activity and a balanced mix of interaction types. They might appreciate a combination of traditional and digital service options.

Recommendations Based on Observations
For Cluster 1: Develop premium, streamlined services tailored for high-value customers, such as exclusive offers and personalized wealth management advice, to enhance their engagement without needing frequent interactions.
For Cluster 2: Enhance digital user experiences and introduce incentives for online activities to boost engagement and satisfaction among digitally active customers.
For Cluster 3: Offer flexible services that combine digital convenience with in-person support, such as hybrid financial products and loyalty programs that reward both online and offline activities.
